This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

A text UI will appear asking about the platform you like to start the project with.

```bash
i - run on iOS
a - run on Android
d - open Dev Menu
r - reload app
```

If everything is set up correctly and the emulator is open, the app should run perfectly.

You can follow and read the official React Native documentation and troubleshooting page.
